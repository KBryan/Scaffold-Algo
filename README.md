# Algorand Scaffold Proposal

Author : Kwame Bryan<br>
Status: Pending<br>
Type: Algorand Ecosystem<br>
Category: ALGO_ECO_SYS<br>
Created: Feb 22 2020 <br>


# Simple Summary
Create a dApp scaffolding framework that will allow Algorand developers to quickly build / iterate and deploy dApps to the Algorand centric dApps.<br>
The framework will also come with a list of pre-made dApp templates that can be re-used and have been audited by Algorand INC.

# Motivation
Provide Algorand developers a framework for building secure dApps quickly uses a business logic approach to dApp development. <br>

There is currently scaffold-eth that is developed for the Ethereum platform where the movtivation for this project started.  Although, this is a great project. The focus of scaffold-algo will not only be a framework for quickly and easily developing and deploying dApps and smart contract to the Algorand blockchain<br>It will be built with Algorand development best practices baked in. The are many tools currently that I would leverage.<br>

# Features

Like Scaffold-Eth. Scaffold-Algo will be a combination and blending of various different Algorand and Ecosystem technologies. Here is a list of some tools I'm thinking of using and 

Sandbox: algod + indexer), Algorand Smart Contract (TEAL)<br>
WebApp (React Framework). Spins up a network, creates accounts, deploys a hello world application (set of smart contracts) and presents the WebApp front end to the user. Guides the user thru modifying the smart contracts and UI to iterate on the DApp.<br>

[ReactJS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html "")<br>
For the visual UI/UX ALGO components framework(send /sign transaction / QR Codes) etc Premade dApp templates<br>
[Scaffold-Eth](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth "")<br>
The main motivation and a visual representation of how 0.1 would initially function replacing Ethereum functionality with Algorand.<br>
[Algorand Studio](https://github.com/ObsidianLabs/AlgorandStudio "")<br>
[Algorand Builder](https://github.com/scale-it/algorand-builder "")<br>
Both used in compiling and deploying Algorand Smart Contracts<br>
[Rand Labs](https://github.com/randlabs "")<br>
Third party SDK.

#Specification

I'm not sure as this is a work in progress


#Time Start

TBD
