Author : Kwame Bryan<br>
Status: Pending<br>
Type: Algorand Ecosystem<br>
Category: ALGO_ECO_SYS<br>
Created: Feb 22 2020 <br>


# Simple Summary
Create a dApp scaffolding framework that will allow Algorand developers to quickly build / iterate and deploy dApps to the Algorand centric dApps.<br>
The framework will also come with a list of pre-made dApp templates that can be re-used and have been audited by Algorand INC.

# Motivation
Provide Algorand developers a framework for building secure dApps quickly uses a business logic approach to dApp development. <br>

There is currently scaffold-eth that is developed for the Ethereum platform where the movtivation for this project started.  Although, this is a great project. The focus of scaffold-algo will not only be a framework for quickly and easily developing and deploying dApps and smart contract to the Algorand blockchain<br>It will be built with Algorand development best practices baked in. The are many tools currently that I would leverage.<br>

[ReactJS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html "")<br>
For the visual UI/UX ALGO components framework(send /sign transaction / QR Codes) etc Premade dApp templates<br>
[Scaffold-Eth](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth "")<br>
The main motivation and a visual representation of how 0.1 would initially function replacing Ethereum functionality with Algorand.<br>
[Algorand Studio](https://github.com/ObsidianLabs/AlgorandStudio "")<br>
[Algorand Builder](https://github.com/scale-it/algorand-builder "")<br>
Both used in compiling and deploying Algorand Smart Contracts<br>

Third party SDK.
